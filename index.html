										<h2>Education is the greatest weapon.</h2>
										<p>Education is the greatest resource to prevent child marriage and poverty.

										Women and girls need basic computer education and internet access to escape poverty, rise above gender discrimination, and succeed in today’s increasingly digital and global workforce. During the pandemic lockdown, many girls were forced to halt or delay their education and became vulnerable to child marriage.</p>
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>Every child has the right to a safe, formal, quality education and access to lifelong learning. However, due to a combination of factors, many girls are forced to leave school while others never have the opportunity to go in the first place.

									   Lockdowns and school closures due to COVID-19 have hit girls’ education particularly hard and threaten to roll back years of progress..</p>

								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>Girl education is very important for the empowerment of women.
										It reduces the infant mortality rate since a learned mother will always take good care of her child.</p>

							<h2>What Do We Mean by Education?</h2>
							<p>It says,</p>
						</header>
						<p>THE RIGHT KIND of education is not concerned with any ideology, however much it may promise a future utopia: it is not based on any system, however carefully thought out, nor is it a means of conditioning the individual in some special manner. Education in the true sense is helping the individual to be mature and free, to flower greatly in love and goodness. That is what we should be interested in, and not in shaping the child according to some idealistic pattern. The highest function of education is to bring about an integrated individual who is capable of dealing with life as a whole.</p>
